## Project Overview  
**BeShuttle** is a mobile companion app developed for **De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde (DLS-CSB)** to enhance the e-shuttle experience. The application addresses common challenges like inconsistent shuttle timings and lack of updates by providing:
- 🛰️ Real-time shuttle tracking  
- 📅 Live schedule monitoring  
- 👥 Rider count notifications

---

## Key Features  
- **GPS Real-Time Tracking** – Live updates on shuttle locations.  
- **Schedule Monitoring** – Accurate arrival times, with alerts for delays.  
- **Rider Count Updates** – Displays shuttle crowd level estimates.  

---

## User Research Insights  
Findings from surveys and interviews:  
- **65%** struggled to determine shuttle locations in real time.  
- **35%** expressed the need for a feature showing rider count.  
- **60%** reported inconvenience due to lack of notifications.  
- Common frustrations: *inconsistent shuttle schedules* and *no real-time alerts*.

---

## Competitive Analysis  
Apps like **Pasahero**, **Irenbus**, and **RideExpress** offer similar features but fall short in privacy and school-specific integration.  
**BeShuttle** stands out by being:
- **Tailored for DLS-CSB students and staff**  
- **Minimal in permissions & data collection**  
- **Focused on safety and accuracy**

---

## Wireframes & Prototype Screens  
- 🏠 **Home** – Displays current status of e-shuttles  
- 📍 **Tracker** – Shows shuttle’s live map location  
- 📅 **Schedule** – Lists estimated arrival times  
- 🔢 **Rider Count** – Displays occupancy of each shuttle
